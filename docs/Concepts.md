# Concept

There are only 2 main concepts to Celestial. 

## Groupings

RTK definitions generated by Celestial group your endpoints into *groupings*. Typically, each grouping contains endpoints for a single resource category. We suggest that you group endpoints in the resource of the base path of the URL.

Consider the following todo app as an example. The app has the following endpoints

1. get tasks
2. post task
3. put task color
4. put task status
5. delete task
6. get colors
7. get status: returns all the status

So these endpoints can be grouped as follows:

1. task: get tasks, post task, put task color, put task status, delete task
2. color: get color
3. status: get status

We have not validated this hunhc, but there will always be a one-to-one mapping between the grouping and the database schema. PS: we will implement support for normalized caching soon.

## Indexing Data

RTK provides you caching support. Caching happens on grouping level. So in the above example, tasks, colors and status will be cached.
